		// ********** All Parts:

		#LOC.ftnm_manufacturer = Nucleonics Ltd.
		
		// ********** Part: bl40n

		#LOC.ftnm_bl40n_description = Advanced, compact spherical outflow reactor design. The BL-40-N is designed for multiple mission roles, and is designed to be used alone or in clusters.
		#LOC.ftnm_bl40n_title = FTmN BL-40 Atomic Rocket

		// ********** Part: ftmn180

		#LOC.ftnm_ftmn180_description = The FTmN SC-450 is the pinnacle of classic reactor design. The engine was designed with modularity in mind, and Nucleotronics are hard at work developing thrust augmentation & power-generating turbine packs for all your future modular nuclear rocket system needs.
		#LOC.ftnm_ftmn180_title = FTmN SC-450 Atomic Rocket

		// ********** Part: ftmn400

		#LOC.ftnm_ftmn400_description = The goal of this engine is to provide something enormous to stick on the end of very big spacecraft. It houses a reactor capable of powering (or in unfortunate cases, rendering uninhabitable) a small city, has doubled-up turbopumps to aid in looking impressive and an exhaust manifold that may have been chosen simply because it looks like one off an especially large rocket engine.
		#LOC.ftnm_ftmn400_title = FTmN CCGC-1000 Atomic Rocket

		// ********** Part: ftmn80

		#LOC.ftnm_ftmn80_description = The Fission Thermal Nuclear Rocket SC-200 was the first in a long line of high performance nuclear engines. Notable features include the worryingly lacking radiation shielding and the core design optimised for usage of typical liquid fuel, offering great thrust and wonderful Isp.
